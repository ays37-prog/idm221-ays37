        <h1>BUSINESS OWNER</h1>
        <h2>CrochetByShmelle</h2>

        <img src="Images/Etsy.png" alt="Photo of Amelia's successful etsy shop" class="Etsy">
      
        <p>After learning how to crochet in the summer of 2023, I launched an Etsy shop to share
          my handmade crochet creations with the world. Having an Etsy shop had me singlehandedly 
          managing all business and design operations. After 2 years of learning to prototype origional products, 
          photograph compelling images, craft always with high attention to detail, 
          and listen and answer all customer needs, I achieved continuous shop success.</p>

        <h2>The Skills that Etsy Taught me:</h2>
        <p></p>

        <li>Problem Solving: I listened to user pain-points, identified the root causes, and resolved issues by 
            refining my designs and tweaking production methods</li>
            <p></p>

        <li>Consitency & Reliability: I maintained production pace, made shop 
          updates regularly, and upheld high quality outputs </li>
          <p></p>

        <li>Marketing: I wrote compeling product descriptions, creating promotional 
          content, and understood how to engage audiences</li>
          <p></p>

        <li>Customer service skills: I communicated clearly and warmly to answer questions, 
          resolve issues, and build trust</li>
          <p></p>

        <li>Time Management: balanced hours of production with hours of school through high focus and discipline</li>
        <p></p>

        <h2>From this Experience:</h2>

        <p>My dedication to quality and understanging what users desire developed me as a designer,
          and helped me achieve Etsy's Star Seller badge which recognizes me for my reliable service, 
          thoughtful communication, and quality craftsmanship. 
          I'm excited to continue in balancing my time to my education and crochet 
          to perform my passion and and understand the world of digital and product design.</p>

          <h1>CASE STUDY #1</h1>
          <h2>MedicRegister: Redesigning a Decades-Old Website</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p>MedicRegister.com is an online platform where individuals who
            seek medical resources can browse and buy from 45,000 listings of worldwide products and services. </p> 
 
      <img src="Images/Medic.png" alt="Screenshot of the awful MedicRegister Website I made better" class="Medic">

          <p>Users felt overwhelmed and frustrated because all the pages were visually cluttered, 
             had an influx of competing colors, and displayed too much information at once with poor organization. 
             The combination of poor signifiers, misleading tab names, and inconsistent navigation made experiences 
             quite frustrating. Overall, MedicRegister's outdated design caused heavy 
             cognitive overload which slowed them down made simple tasks tricky to perform. </p>
          
             <p>For this case study, I only adressed and redesigned MedicRegister's home page.</p>
             <h4>Wireframe Software: Balsamiq </h4>

          <h2>What I Took Out:</h2>

          <p>The visual noise which made experiences frustrating was
            corrected through the elimination of excessive colors, cutting back on volume of on-screen content,
            and removal of ambiguous and inaccurate page names that worked against user comprehension.</p>

          <h2>What I Introduced:</h2>

          <p>I adopted a clearer structural format that takes after modern interfaces to give
            users a sense of familiarity in navigation. 
            I also implemented an always-visable top and bottom navigation bar so users can now understand 
            where they are and access other pages from any page. Additionally, I grouped miscellaneous information 
            into more logical categories with consistent distancing. This successfully separated the once dense mixtures of text 
            that made MedicRegister somewhat untrustwory, bringing a sense of clean professionalism to the site.</p>
            
            <p>
            Furthermore, collapsible tabs and subtabs bring visual hierarchy to the browser and reduce the amount of clutter 
            on the screen. Lastly, I renamed misleading tab titles to something that accurately describes the content, 
            so users instantly understand each page's purpose with correctness. These kinds of changes alleviate much 
            mental fatigure that came from daunting processes of cutting through information piles.
