         <p>I am an aspiring UX/UI designer with a strong foundation in fine arts, blending creativity, problem-solving, 
            and user-centered thinking into every project I take on. I enjoy empathizing with people and listening to their needs, 
            doing what I can to make all experiences seamless, inclusive, and meaningful. 
        </p>
 
        <p>I am pursuing a B.S. in User Experience & Interaction Design at Drexel University, graduating
          in May 2029. In my education, I am developing the necessary design, research, and technical skills to bring 
          positive user-focused digital experiences to life.

        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>My interest in the arts began at a very young age. As a toddler, my mom would find me on the living room 
          floor with my pencils, completely absorbed in creating. My fascination with art-making stayed with me 
          throughout my childhood, and by seventh grade I began preparing for New York City's competitive arts high schools auditions.

        <p></p>  
        <p>The process of preparing lasted a year and a half and was was intense and high-pressure time, sometimes 
          feeling like the college application process at the ripe age of twelve. It was a period of deep commitment, teaching
          me early on how much I valued design in my life, and the effort 
          I was willing to put in to pursue it.

        <p></p>  

        <p>In 2020, I was accepted into the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts.
          My highschool provided rigorous courses and a supportive environment to grow 
          as an artist. I strengthened my abilities in creative problem-solving, visual storytelling, and clear design communication. 
          My classmates and I forged close connections, many of whom have gone on to successful careers in the arts.

        <p></p>  

        <p>I continue to appreciate traditional art and the skills I have developed over my lifetime, but I am drawn towards this field 
          where I may combine creativity and problem-solving in a more impactful way. UX./UI design is appealing 
          to me because it channels empathetic instincts with design sensibilities into edveloping better experiences that help 
          others. For me, UX/UI is a way to take the passion for creating into fostering beautiful interactive experiences.
