        <p>Hi, my name is Amelia Suchanek!</p>

         <p>I am a UX/UI designer with a strong foundation in fine arts and digital design, blending creativity, problem-solving, 
            and user-centered thinking into every project I undertake. I am passionate about crafting experiences that are intuitive, 
            inclusive, and meaningful, where design not only looks good but feels natural and purposeful to the people who use it.
        </p>
 
       
        <p>I am currently pursuing a B.S. in User Experience & Interaction Design at Drexel University, with an anticipated graduation 
          in May 2029. Through my studies, I am developing the technical, research, and interaction design skills necessary to bring 
          thoughtful, user-focused digital experiences to life.

        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>My interest in the arts began at a very young age. As a toddler, my mom would often find me sprawled on the living room 
          rug with pencils, markers, and sketchbooks, completely absorbed in creating. This early fascination with making and 
          experimenting stayed with me throughout my childhood and became a defining part of who I am.
        </p> 

        <p>By seventh grade, I set my sights on auditioning for some of New York City's most competitive arts high schools, 
          programs designed to challenge students across multiple artistic disciplines while fostering deep technical skill and 
          creativity. My ultimate goal was to attend Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, whose alumni include celebrated artists, actors, 
          and musicians like Jennifer Aniston, Nicki Minaj, and Timothée Chalamet.
        </p>

        <p>I began my audition preparation at age 12, working with a private tutor for three hours each week. Together, we built a 
          25-page portfolio, practiced timed figure drawings, and honed both my technical and creative skills. The process, spanning 
          a year and a half, was intense, high-pressure, and sometimes overwhelming—almost like applying to college before I was even 
          a teenager. It was a period of deep commitment, showing me early on how much I valued art in my life and how much effort 
          I was willing to dedicate to pursue it seriously.
        </p>

        <p>After auditioning at several schools, I was accepted into the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, founded by Tony Bennett. 
          While it was not my first choice, the school provided a rigorous and supportive environment where I could continue growing 
          as an artist. There, I strengthened my abilities in creative problem-solving, visual storytelling, and design communication. 
          My classmates and I forged close connections, many of whom have gone on to successful careers in the arts—earning awards, 
          exhibiting in museums, creating murals in urban spaces, and building thriving independent businesses selling their work
        </p>

        <p>While I continue to appreciate traditional art and the skills I have developed over my lifetime, I am drawn to a field 
          where I can combine my creativity with problem-solving in a more technical and human-centered way. This is why I chose to 
          focus on UX/UI design. It allows me to channel my artistic instincts and design sensibilities into experiences that help 
          others, creating meaningful interactions between people and the digital world. For me, UX/UI is a way to take the passion 
          that has shaped my life since childhood and apply it to making the everyday experiences of others more engaging, 
          accessible, and beautiful.
