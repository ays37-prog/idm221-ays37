    <p>
      I am an aspiring UX/UI designer with a strong foundation in fine arts, blending creativity, problem-solving, 
      and user-centered thinking into every project I take on. I enjoy empathizing with people and listening to their needs, 
      doing what I can to make all experiences seamless, inclusive, and meaningful. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I am pursuing a B.S. in User Experience & Interaction Design at Drexel University, graduating
      in May 2029. In my education, I am developing the necessary design, research, and technical skills to bring 
      positive user-focused digital experiences to life.

    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p></p>
      
    <p>My interest in the arts began at a very young age. As a toddler, my mom would find me on the living room 
     floor with my pencils, completely absorbed in creating. My fascination with art-making stayed with me 
     throughout my childhood, and by seventh grade I began preparing for New York City's competitive arts high schools auditions.

    <p>
      The process of preparing lasted a year and a half and was was intense and high-pressure time, sometimes 
      feeling like the college application process at the ripe age of twelve. It was a period of deep commitment, teaching
      me early on how much I valued design in my life, and the effort 
      was willing to put in to pursue it.

    <p></p>  

    <p>
      In 2020, I was accepted into the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts.
      My highschool provided rigorous courses and a supportive environment to grow 
      as an artist. I strengthened my abilities in creative problem-solving, visual storytelling, and clear design communication. 
      My classmates and I forged close connections, many of whom have gone on to successful careers in the arts.

    <p>
      I continue to appreciate traditional art and the skills I have developed over my lifetime, but I am drawn towards this field 
      where I may combine creativity and problem-solving in a more impactful way. UX./UI design is appealing 
      to me because it channels empathetic instincts with design sensibilities into edveloping better experiences that help 
      others. For me, UX/UI is a way to take the passion for creating into fostering beautiful interactive experiences.
