       <p>I am a UX/UI designer with a strong background in fine arts and digital design. I bring creativity, problem solving, 
        and user centered thinking into every project I take on. My passion lies in designing experiences that feel intuitive, inclusive, and meaningful. 
        <br><br>
        I am currently pursuing a B.S. in User Experience & Interaction Design at Drexel University

        About
        <br><br>
        I've been drawn to art for as long as I can remember. As a toddler, my mom would often find me sprawled on the floor, spending hours and hours drawing. 
        This passion stayed with me throughout childhood and led me to audition for multiple competitive and specialized arts focused high schools. 
        My acceptance into one of these rigorous programs further immersed me in the fine arts, where I strengthened my technical skills in drawing and painting, 
        built a foundation in creative problem solving, and learned how to effectively communicate through visuals. 
Outside the classroom, I launched my own Etsy shop, where I sold handmade crochet creations that quickly gained traction. Since 2023, I've been recognized as a 
Star Seller, an experience that not only grew my entrepreneurial and design skills but also showed me the value of connecting with people through craft.
