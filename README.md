# My Portfolio Project

This is my personal portfolio website, designed in Figma and coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my outside projects, work in the community, and experience in UX/UI design. 

## Features
- Home page with a breif introduction
- Contact page with the necessary information to reach out to me
- About page that covers my history
- Major page about why I am studying UXID at Drexel University
- Resume Page which will give users a PDF of my resume, and a gallery of my work
- Experiance page of projects I have worked on that are relevant to design and user experience

## Tools Used
- Figma for creating the wireframes and providing a guiding structure that organizes all of my content
- VS Code where I bring the wireframe to life in a browser
- Git & Github to save my project and allow all changes to be logged, documented, and observable by my peers.
